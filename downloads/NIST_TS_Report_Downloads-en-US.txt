There's a new menu link on the NIST Technical Series Publications List page Report Downloads.

0:13
These pages display a searchable table with the number of hits and visitors for each NIST Technical Series Publication PDF.

0:21
This video will show you how to view the monthly pages and the raw data as well.

0:27
The monthly pages are generated using some Python in a Jupiter notebook.

This is also linked on the page as well.

Let's take a look at August 2024.

0:40
You'll see two blocks of Python that reads the CSV file and displays a table with a search box.

0:47
It automatically sorts by most hits descending.

0:53
You can see three columns Hits, visitors and File hits count the number of times a file was accessed or downloaded.

1:03
A visitor is counted when a file is accessed on a particular date by a unique user, and the file column displays the reports URL.

1:12
For a technical description, see the landing page in the link here.

1:19
You're probably most concerned about searching for a specific report or series.

1:24
To filter what's displayed on the table, simply type the series abbreviation with a period or- depending on the series URL structure.

1:33
Let's try SP dot 1800.

1:38
We see it quickly filters only publications that fall in this category.

1:42
You can filter down even further by following the URL structure.

1:46
For example, SP 1800-, 29.

1:52
Let's look at SP .800.

1:56
It has 530 entries for this series, but only displays 10 of them at a time.

2:05
You can simply select Copy, which will copy the filtered table, in this case 530 entries, or download a CSV or Excel spreadsheet of the same filtered entries.

2:17
It's that simple.

2:20
One more thing to mention is the raw CSV files.

2:23
These files were generated directly from the web logs in a neatly packaged CSV file.

2:30
The folder is linked on the report Downloads page 2 at the bottom, hosted on GitHub.
